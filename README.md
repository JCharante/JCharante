<summary>ðŸ’¬ Funny trivia about me, when I was 15...</summary> I went to a local frontend meetup where that day the presentation was on Elm (it was super cool). I told everybody I was a student and a sophomore so I figured I should start attending dev meetups for fun (because I genuinely enjoy it), but they assumed I was a college sophomore instead of a high school sophomore because they offered me some beer. <!-- School ended at 3pm and the meetups didn't start until 7-8pm (after work hours) so I didn't go again because I didn't want to sit around 4 hours. In hindsight I could have chilled at the library. -->
